- 👋 Hi, I’m @saowaphak64
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning. I came across Andrew Ng Courses, and I am interested to learn them all. Therefore, I would like to create this page to update my learning and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS229 online and coursea supervised machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project on machine learning and AI.
- 📫 You can email me for further discussion on my posts and coding here.
